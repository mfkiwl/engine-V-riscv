This was the first MF8A18 and engine-V was initially developed and tested, SPI Flash boot for Lattice was first working and debugged with S7-Mini, then ported to Lattice MDP.


NOTE: Board support files for S7-mini will be updated and hopefully pushed to Xilinx board part file repo.

Provided here is minimal board file, it includes only SPI flash and system clock configuration only.
